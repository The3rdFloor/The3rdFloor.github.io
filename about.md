The purpose of this blog is to discuss the field of bioinformatics, and specifically, to discuss its applications
in microbial ecology. In future, I would also like to use it to document my beer tour through Vienna to learn about
the wonderful lagers that Austria is home to.

I am currently a PhD student with the Archaea Biology and Ecogenomics Division at the University of Vienna. My area
of research is in bioinformatics with a focus on metagenomics. I am interested exploiting sequence data to inform 
scientific hypotheses and to make predictions to be tested in labs.
