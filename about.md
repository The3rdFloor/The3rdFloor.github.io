The purpose of this blog is to discuss the field of bioinformatics, and specifically, to discuss its applications
in microbial ecology.

I am a masters student with the Hug Research Group at the University of Waterloo. My area of research is
in metagenomics, and the application of bioinformatics tools to study the interactions of microbes in their
communities, as well as to identify pathways in various environments.
