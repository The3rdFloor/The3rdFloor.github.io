Hello, world!

This is my attempt at building a personal website. The intent will mostly be directed to discussion revolving
around bioinformatics, although possible guest topics may occur. In addition to this, my hope is that the site will
act as a spot for me to discuss any tools or research that I work on, as it becomes publicly available.

Enjoy!
